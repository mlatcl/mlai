### YouTube Videos

There is a YouTube video available of me giving this material at the
[Gaussian Process Road Show in Uganda](http://gpss.cc/gprs13/). The first 25 minutes of the relevant video covers model selection, and then it leads into the video second below which
introduces Bayesian modelling.

### Reading

-   Sections 1.5-1.6 of Rogers and Girolami.
-   Sections 3.1-3.4 (pg 95-117) Although you haven't covered the beta
    density *yet*.
-   Section 1.2.3 (pg 21-24) and 1.2.6 (start from just past eq 1.64 pg
    30-32) of Bishop
-   Section 1.3 of Bishop (pg 32-33)
