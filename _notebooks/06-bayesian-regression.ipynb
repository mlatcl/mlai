    "In the overdetermined system, we resolved the problem by introducing slack variables, $\\epsilon_i$, which needed to be estimated for each point. The slack variable represented the difference between our actual prediction and the true observation. This is known as the *residual*. By introducing the slack variable we now have an additional $n$ variables to estimate, one for each data point, $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$. This actually turns the overdetermined system into an underdetermined system. Introduction of $n$ variables, plus the original $m$ and $c$ gives us $n+2$ parameters to be estimated from $n$ observations, which actually makes the system *underdetermined*. However, we then made a probabilistic assumption about the slack variables, we assumed that the slack variables were distributed according to a probability density. And for the moment we have been assuming that density was the Gaussian,\n",

    "## A Philosophical Dispute: Probabilistic Treatment of Parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "The follow up question is whether we can do the same thing with the parameters. If we have two parameters and only one unknown can we place a probability distribution over the parameters, as we did with the slack variables? The answer is yes, and from a philosophical perspective placing a probability distribution over the *parameters* is known as the *Bayesian* approach. This is because Thomas Bayes, in a [1763 essay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_towards_solving_a_Problem_in_the_Doctrine_of_Chances) published at the Royal Society introduced the [Bernoulli distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution) with a probabilistic interpretation for the *parameters*. Later statisticians such as [Ronald Fisher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) objected to the use of probability distributions for *parameters*, and so in an effort to discredit the approach the referred to it as Bayesian. However, the earliest practioners of modelling, such as Laplace applied the approach as the most natural thing to do for dealing with unknowns (whether they were parameters or variables). Unfortunately, this dispute led to a split in the modelling community that still has echoes today. It is known as the Bayesian vs Frequentist controversy. From my own perspective, I think that it is a false dichotomy, and that the two approaches are actually complementary. My own focus research focus is on *modelling* and in that context, the use of probability is vital. For frequenstist statisticians, such as Fisher, the emphasis was on the value of the evidence in the data for a particular hypothesis. This is known as hypothesis testing. The two approaches can be unified because one of the most important approaches to hypothesis testing is to [compute the ratio of the likelihoods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test), and the result of applying a probability distribution to the parameters is merely to arrive at a different form of the likelihood."

    "## The Bayesian Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to study Bayesian approaches to regression. In the Bayesian approach we define a *prior* density over our parameters, $m$ and $c$ or more generally $\\mathbf{w}$. This prior distribution gives us a range of expected values for our parameter *before* we have seen the data. The object in Bayesian inference is to then compute the *posterior* density which is the effect on the density of having observed the data. In standard probability notation we write the prior distribution as,\n",
    "$$p(\\mathbf{w}),$$\n",
    "so it is the *marginal* distribution for the parameters, i.e. the distribution we have for the parameters without any knowledge about the data. The posterior distribution is written as,\n",
    "$$p(\\mathbf{w}|\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X}).$$\n",
    "So the posterior distribution is the *conditional* distribution for the parameters given the data (which in this case consists of pairs of observations including response variables (or targets), $y_i$, and covariates (or inputs) $\\mathbf{x}_i$. Where here we are allowing the inputs to be multivariate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior is recovered from the prior using *Bayes' rule*. Which is simply a rewriting of the product rule. We can recover Bayes rule as follows. The product rule of probability tells us that the joint distribution is given as the product of the conditional and the marginal. Dropping the inputs from our conditioning for the moment we have,\n",
    "$$p(\\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{y})=p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{w})p(\\mathbf{w}),$$\n",
    "where we see we have related the joint density to the prior density and the *likelihood* from our previous investigation of regression,\n",
    "$$p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{w}) = \\prod_{i=1}^n\\mathcal{N}(y_i | \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}_i, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "which arises from the assumption that our observation is given by\n",
    "$$y_i = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}_i + \\epsilon_i.$$\n",
    "In other words this is the Gaussian likelihood we have been fitting by minimizing the sum of squares. Have a look at [the session on multivariate regression](./week3.ipynb) as a reminder.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've introduce the likelihood, but we don't have  relationship with the posterior, however, the product rule can also be written in the following way\n",
    "$$p(\\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{y}) = p(\\mathbf{w}|\\mathbf{y})p(\\mathbf{y}),$$\n",
    "where here we have simply used the opposite conditioning. We've already introduced the *posterior* density above. This is the density that represents our belief about the parameters *after* observing the data. This is combined with the *marginal likelihood*, sometimes also known as the evidence. It is the marginal likelihood, because it is the original likelihood of the data with the parameters marginalised, $p(\\mathbf{y})$. Here it's conditioned on nothing, but in practice you should always remember that everything here is conditioned on things like model choice: which set of basis functions. Because it's a regression problem, its also conditioned on the inputs. Using the equality between the two different forms of the joint density  we recover\n",
    "$$p(\\mathbf{w}|\\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{w})p(\\mathbf{w})}{p(\\mathbf{y})}$$\n",
    "where we divided both sides by $p(\\mathbf{y})$ to recover this result. Let's re-introduce the conditioning on the input locations (or covariates), $\\mathbf{X}$ to write the full form of Bayes' rule for the regression problem. \n",
    "$$p(\\mathbf{w}|\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X}) = \\frac{p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{X})p(\\mathbf{w})}{p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X})}$$\n",
    "where the posterior density for the parameters given the data is $p(\\mathbf{w}|\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X})$, the marginal likelihood is $p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X})$, the prior density is $p(\\mathbf{w})$ and our original regression likelihood is given by $p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{X})$. It turns out that to compute the posterior the only things we need to do are define the prior and the likelihood. The other term on the right hand side can be computed by *the sum rule*. It is one of the key equations of Bayesian inference, the expectation of the likelihood under the prior, this process is known as marginalisation,\n",

Marginalisation of a variable goes from a likelihood where the variable is in place, to a new likelihood where all possible values of that variable (under the prior) have been considered and weighted in the integral. \n",

Compare plots of the hold out validation area for different degrees and the cross validation error for different degrees. Why are they so different? Select a suitable polynomial for characterising the differences in the predictions.
