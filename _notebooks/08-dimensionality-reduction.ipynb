    "These are certainly labels that can be provided by humans, but they were\n",

    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning enables computers to form similar categorizations\n",
    "on data that is too large scale for us to process. When the Greek\n",

    "of the Platonic ideal. The Platonic ideal bird is the bird that is most\n",
    "bird-like or the chair that is most chair-like. In some sense, the task\n",
    "in clustering is to define different clusters, by finding their Platonic\n",

    "To perform clustering on a computer we need to define a notion of either\n",
    "similarity or distance between the objects and their Platonic ideal, the\n",

    "center for category $j$ by a vector $\\boldsymbol{ \\mu}_j$. This vector\n",
    "contains the ideal features of a bird, a chair, or whatever category $j$\n",
    "is. In clustering we can either think in terms of similarity of the\n",
    "objects, or distances. We want objects that are similar to each other to\n",
