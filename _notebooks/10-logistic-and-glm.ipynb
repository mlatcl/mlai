    "The [naive Bayes assumption](./week9.ipynb) allowed us to specify a class conditional density, $p(\\mathbf{x}_i|y_i, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, through assuming that the features were conditionally independent given the label. Combined with our assumption that the data points are conditionally independent given the parameters, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, this allowed us to specify a joint density over the entire data set, $p(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X})$. We argued that modeling the joint density is a powerful approach because we can answer any particular question we have about the data through the sum rule and the product rule of probability. We can condition on the training data and query the value of an unseen test point. If we have missing data, then we can integrate over the missing point (marginalise) and obtain our best prediction despite the absence of some of the features for a point. However, it comes at the cost of a particular modeling assumption. Namely, to make modeling practical we assumed that the features were conditionally independent given the feature label. In other words, for any given point, if we know its class, then its features will be independent. This is a very strong assumption. For example, if we were classifying the sex of an individual given their height and weight, naive Bayes would assume that if we knew their sex, then the height and weight would be independent. This is clearly wrong, the dependence between height and weight is not dictated only by the sex of an individual, there is a natural correlation between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling the entire joint density allows us to deal with different questions, that we may not have envisaged at the model *design time*. It contrasts with the approach we took for regression where we specifically chose to model the conditional density for the target values, $\\mathbf{y}$, given the input locations, $\\mathbf{X}$. That density, $p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X})$, effectively assumes that the question we'll be asked at *run time* is known. In particular, we expect to be asked about the value of the function, $y^*$, given a particular input location, $\\mathbf{x}^*$. We don't expect to be asked about the value of an input given a particular observation. That would require placing an additional prior over the input location for each point, $p(\\mathbf{x}_i)$. Of course, it's possible to conceive of a model like this, and indeed that is how we proceeded for [dimensionality reduction](./week8.ipynb). However, if we know we will always have all the inputs at run time, it may make sense to *directly* model the conditional density, $p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X})$. \n",

    "A logistic regression is an approach to classification which extends the linear basis function models we've already explored. Rather than modeling the output of the function directly the assumption is that we model the *log-odds* with the basis functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [odds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds) are defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive outcome, to the probability of a negative outcome. If the probability of a positive outcome is denoted by $\\pi$, then the odds are computed as $\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}$. Odds are widely used by [bookmakers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker) in gambling, although a bookmakers odds won't normalise: i.e. if you look at the equivalent probabilities, and sum over the probability of all outcomes the bookmakers are considering, then you won't get one. This is how the bookmaker makes a profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because a probability is always between zero and one, the odds are always between $0$ and $\\infty$. If the positive outcome is unlikely the odds are close to zero, if it is very likely then the odds become close to infinite. Taking the logarithm of the odds maps the odds from the positive half space to being across the entire real line. Odds that were between 0 and 1 (where the negative outcome was more likely) are mapped to the range between $-\\infty$ and $0$. Odds that are greater than 1 are mapped to the range between $0$ and $\\infty$. Considering the log odds therefore takes a number between 0 and 1 (the probability of positive outcome) and maps it to the entire real line. The function that does this is known as the [logit function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit),\n",
