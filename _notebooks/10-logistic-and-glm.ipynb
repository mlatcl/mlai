    "features were conditionally independent given the label. Combined with\n",
    "our assumption that the data points are conditionally independent given\n",
    "the parameters, $\\boldsymbol{ \\theta}$, this allowed us to specify a\n",
    "joint density over the entire data set, $p(\\mathbf{ y}, \\mathbf{X})$. We\n",
    "argued that modeling the joint density is a powerful approach because we\n",
    "can answer any particular question we have about the data through the\n",
    "sum rule and the product rule of probability. We can condition on the\n",
    "training data and query the value of an unseen test point. If we have\n",
    "missing data, then we can integrate over the missing point (marginalise)\n",
    "and obtain our best prediction despite the absence of some of the\n",
    "features for a point. However, it comes at the cost of a particular\n",
    "modeling assumption. Namely, to make modeling practical we assumed that\n",
    "the features were conditionally independent given the feature label. In\n",
    "other words, for any given point, if we know its class, then its\n",
    "features will be independent. This is a very strong assumption. For\n",
    "example, if we were classifying the sex of an individual given their\n",
    "height and weight, naive Bayes would assume that if we knew their sex,\n",
    "then the height and weight would be independent. This is clearly wrong,\n",
    "the dependence between height and weight is not dictated only by the sex\n",
    "of an individual, there is a natural correlation between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling the entire joint density allows us to deal with different\n",
    "questions, that we may not have envisaged at the model *design time*. It\n",
    "contrasts with the approach we took for regression where we specifically\n",
    "chose to model the conditional density for the target values,\n",
    "$\\mathbf{ y}$, given the input locations, $\\mathbf{X}$. That density,\n",
    "$p(\\mathbf{ y}|\\mathbf{X})$, effectively assumes that the question we’ll\n",

    "location, $\\mathbf{ x}^*$. We don’t expect to be asked about the value\n",
    "of an input given a particular observation. That would require placing\n",
    "an additional prior over the input location for each point,\n",
    "$p(\\mathbf{ x}_i)$. Of course, it’s possible to conceive of a model like\n",
    "this, and indeed that is how we proceeded for . However, if we know we\n",
