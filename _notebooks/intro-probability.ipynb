    "Welcome to the Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence course. In\n",
    "this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and\n",
    "data science. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that\n",
    "describe how to model. An integrated part of that is how we approach\n",
    "data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see\n",
    "in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook provides us with a way of interacting with the data that\n",
    "allows us to give the computer instructions and explore the nature of a\n",
    "data set. It is *different* to normal coding, but it is related. In this\n",
    "course you will, through intensive practical sessions and labs, develop\n",
    "your understanding of the interaction between data and computers. The\n",
    "first thing we are going to do is ask you to forget a bit about what you\n",
    "think about normal programming, or ‘classical software engineering.’\n",
    "Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and\n",
    "testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the\n",
    "design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as\n",
    "*exploratory data analysis*. You will learn some of the techniques of\n",
    "exploratory data analysis in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular difference between classical software engineering and data\n",
    "analysis is the way in which programs are run. Classically we spend a\n",
    "deal of time working with a text editor, writing code. Compilations are\n",
    "done on a regular basis and aspects of the code are tested (perhaps with\n",
    "unit tests).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is more like coding in a debugger. In a debugger\n",
    "(particularly a visual debugger) you interact with the data stored in\n",
    "the memory of the computer to try and understand what is happening in\n",
    "the computer, you need to understand exactly what your bug is: you often\n",
    "have a fixed idea of what the program is trying to do, you are just\n",
    "struggling to find out why it isn’t doing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, debugging is an important part of data analysis also, but in\n",
    "some sense it can be seen as its entire premise. You load in a data set\n",
    "into a computer that you don’t understand, your entire objective is to\n",
    "understand the data. This is best done by interogating the data to\n",
    "visualise it or summarize it, just like in a power visual debugger.\n",
    "However, for data science the requirements for visualization and\n",
    "summarization are far greater than in a regular program. When the data\n",
    "is well understood, the actual number of lines of your program may well\n",
    "be very few (particularly if you disregard commands that load in the\n",
    "data and commands which plot your results). If a powerful data science\n",
    "library is available, you may be able to summarize your code with just\n",
    "two or three lines, but the amount of intellectual energy that is\n",
    "expended on writing those three lines is far greater than in standard\n",
    "code."
