    "Over the last two sessions we've begun considering classification models and logistic regresssion. In particular, for naive Bayes, we considered a set of assumptions that allowed us to build a joint model of our data set. In particular for naive Bayes we specified \n",

    "When we form a Gaussian process we do something that is slightly more akin to the naive Bayes approach, but actually is closely related to the generalized linear model approach. Models where we model the entire joint distribution of our training data, $p(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X})$ are sometimes described as *generative models*. Because we can use sampling to generate data sets that represent all our assumptions. However, as we discussed in the sessions on logistic regression and naive Bayes, this can be a bad idea, because if our assumptions are wrong then we can make poor predictions. We can try to make more complex assumptions about data to alleviate the problem, but then this typically leads to challenges for tractable application of the sum  and rules of probability that are needed to compute the relevant marginal and conditional densities. If we know the form of the question we wish to answer then we typically try and represent that directly, through $p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X})$. In practice, we also have been making assumptions of conditional independence given the model parameters, \n",

    "Gaussian processes are *not* normally considered to be *generative models*, but we will be much more interested in the principles of conditioning in Gaussian processes because we will use conditioning to make predictions between our test and training data.

    "To understand the Gaussian process we're going to build on our understanding of the marginal likelihood for Bayesian regression. In the session on [Bayesian regression](./week7.ipynb) we sampled directly from the weight vector, $\\mathbf{w}$ and applied it to the basis matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ to obtain a sample from the prior and a sample from the posterior. It is often helpful to think of modeling techniques as *generative* models. To give some thought as to what the process for obtaining data from the model is. From the perspective of Gaussian processes, we want to start by thinking of basis function models, where the parameters are sampled from a prior, but move to thinking about sampling from the marginal likelihood directly.\n",

Kernel methods are also based around covariance functions, but in the field they are known as Mercer kernels. Mercer kernels have interpretations as inner products in potentially infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. This interpretation arises because, if we take $\\alpha=1$, then the kernel can be expressed as\n",

Mercer's theorem tells us that any valid *positive definite function* can be expressed as this inner product but with the caveat that the inner product could be *infinite length*. This idea has been used quite widely to *kernelize* algorithms that depend on inner products. The kernel functions are equivalent to covariance functions and they are parameterized accordingly. In the kernel modeling community it is generally accepted that kernel parameter estimation is a difficult problem and the normal solution is to cross validate to obtain parameters. This can cause difficulties when a large number of kernel parameters need to be estimated. In Gaussian process modelling kernel parameter estimation (in the simplest case proceeds) by maximum likelihood. This involves taking gradients of the likelihood with respect to the parameters of the covariance function. \n",
