    "Now we will study Bayesian approaches to regression. In the Bayesian\n",
    "approach we define a *prior* density over our parameters, $m$ and $c$ or\n",
    "more generally $\\mathbf{ w}$. This prior distribution gives us a range\n",
    "of expected values for our parameter *before* we have seen the data. The\n",
    "object in Bayesian inference is to then compute the*posterior* density\n",
    "which is the effect on the density of having observed the data. In\n",
    "standard probability notation we write the prior distribution as, $$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{ w}),\n",
    "$$ so it is the *marginal* distribution for the parameters, i.e. the\n",
    "distribution we have for the parameters without any knowledge about the\n",
    "data. The posterior distribution is written as, $$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{ w}|\\mathbf{ y}, \\mathbf{X}).\n",
    "$$ So the posterior distribution is the *conditional* distribution for\n",
    "the parameters given the data (which in this case consists of pairs of\n",
    "observations including response variables (or targets), $y_i$, and\n",
    "covariates (or inputs) $\\mathbf{ x}_i$. Where here we are allowing the\n",
    "inputs to be multivariate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior is recovered from the prior using *Bayes’ rule*. Which is\n",
    "simply a rewriting of the product rule. We can recover Bayes’ rule as\n",
    "follows. The product rule of probability tells us that the joint\n",
    "distribution is given as the product of the conditional and the\n",
    "marginal. Dropping the inputs from our conditioning for the moment we\n",
    "have, $$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{ w}, \\mathbf{ y})=p(\\mathbf{ y}|\\mathbf{ w})p(\\mathbf{ w}),\n",
    "$$ where we see we have related the joint density to the prior density\n",
    "and the *likelihood* from our previous investigation of regression, $$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{ y}|\\mathbf{ w}) = \\prod_{i=1}^n\\mathcal{N}\\left(y_i|\\mathbf{ w}^\\top \\mathbf{ x}_i, \\sigma^2\\right)\n",
    "$$ which arises from the assumption that our observation is given by $$\n",
    "y_i = \\mathbf{ w}^\\top \\mathbf{ x}_i + \\epsilon_i.\n",
    "$$ In other words this is the Gaussian likelihood we have been fitting\n",
    "by minimizing the sum of squares. Have a look at [the session on\n",

    "\n",
    "We’ve introduce the likelihood, but we don’t have relationship with the\n",
    "posterior, however, the product rule can also be written in the\n",

    "p(\\mathbf{ w}, \\mathbf{ y}) = p(\\mathbf{ w}|\\mathbf{ y})p(\\mathbf{ y}),\n",
    "$$ where here we have simply used the opposite conditioning. We’ve\n",
    "already introduced the *posterior* density above. This is the density\n",
    "that represents our belief about the parameters *after* observing the\n",
    "data. This is combined with the *marginal likelihood*, sometimes also\n",
    "known as the evidence. It is the marginal likelihood, because it is the\n",
    "original likelihood of the data with the parameters marginalised,\n",
    "$p(\\mathbf{ y})$. Here it’s conditioned on nothing, but in practice you\n",
